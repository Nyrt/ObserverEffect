Changelog:

Added the beginnings of code for hackable doors.

Added a small amount of smoothing to scrubbing through the timeline to avoid ugly quantization.

Tweaked textures a bit to provide better visibility in the far distance.

Notes:
Need to add a system for displaying whether a level has been completed and how long it took in the menu, in addition to the total time elapsed.

Need to add expendable resources for the player (ergo, a few seconds of invisibility, a few seconds of cut power, a few door codes, etc.

Controls:
WASD to move. Shift sprints, space jumps. Ctrl crouches, Q and E lean left and right. R stops recording.
While paused, White knob on slider scrolls observed time. Grey knob controls target time.
P plays back the timeline at actual speed.
When paused, hold right mouse to look around. Press r to start recording from the current position on the timeline. Press o to optimize the time between the white and grey knobs. C clears the timeline after the observed time. P plays through the timelineine at original speed.

Being spotted by a guard automatically stops recording or optimization. If you are spotted in the timeline due to a change in the past, the period after you are spotted will become paradoxed until you fix the problem area.

In one of the rooms is a capsule that serves as a placeholder level-end marker. try to see how fast you can get there.
